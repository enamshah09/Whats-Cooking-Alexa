# Overview

The What’s cooking recipe application suggests recipe to the user based on
the ingredient specified by the user. We have developed a user-friendly
application with the help of Amazon Alexa which is an intelligent digital virtual
assistant. We have used Amazon Echo Dot speaker with a built-in
microphone for interactive speech user interface. When user speaks, Alexa
quickly responds with recipes or necessary guidelines which matches your
desired cuisine and the ingredients specified. This skill helps in providing
access to thousands of recipes in just few voice commands.

The Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) is a collection of self-service APIs, tools,
documentation, and code samples that makes it fast and easy for you to add
skills to Alexa [1].

## AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without
provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only
when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to
thousands per second [6].

recognition powered by the Amazon Alexa voice service/assistant [2].

The spoonacular Nutrition, Recipe, and Food API allows you to access over
365,000 recipes and 86,000 food products [3].

## Flask – Ask
Flask-Ask is a Flask extension that makes building Alexa skills for the
Amazon Echo easier and much more fun [4].

## Ngrok
ngrok allows you to expose a web server running on your local machine to
the internet [5].
